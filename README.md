# mqtt-seismic
Development of a prototype to monitor seismic and environmental actions in historical buildings and monuments. 
Using comercial sensors (DHT11 (Temp-Hum), ADXL345(Accelerometer)) and a RBPi 3 Model B.
Importance of the IoT using the MQTT protocol for the transmission of data through the installation of a Mosquitto broker in the RBPi.
Python 2.7.14
I have used the following MIT License libraries to design my code.
Adafruit_GPIO.I2C
Adafruit_Python_ADXL345
DHT11_Python
And finally the library Paho.mqtt.python to create the channel to post and suscribe to messages.
